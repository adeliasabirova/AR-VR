A repository for the education consists of homeworks for passed courses.

1) C# basic course includes homeworks and lesson practical tasks.
2) C# advanced course includes project "Asteroids" that is a game made with visual studio tools, WPF project "Employee book" made with ms sql, and some homework tasks.
3) Unity basic—ã is base course that consist of project "Shooter" made with unity3d engine. (the code is little bit unclean, however different tools were used as animation, particle system, audio, navigation, etc.)
4) Architecture and patterns course includes three projects, basic homework on c#, MVC project "Asteroids" - game based on unity2d (the visual part is not what i considered about mostly, the main part for me was code development), and MVVM project "Arkanoid" - game based on unity2d.
